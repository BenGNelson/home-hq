"""
SQLite cache for the Plex library browser.

Phase 1 of Home HQ was deliberately stateless. The library browser is the first
feature that needs storage: caching thousands of media items locally so search,
sort, and pagination are instant and don't hammer the Plex API on every click.

We use the stdlib `sqlite3` (no ORM) — the schema is tiny and the queries are
simple. The DB file lives on a Docker volume (see compose) so it survives image
rebuilds. Nothing host-specific or secret is stored here — only public-ish media
metadata (titles, years, runtimes, resolutions). No file paths.
